As you probably know, Flutter is a UI toolkit that enables app developers to build for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. Flutter enables you to build beautiful apps, giving you complete control over every pixel on the screen. It’s fast, taking advantage of your device’s capabilities with support for hardware-accelerated graphics and natively-compiled machine code. It’s productive, with technologies like stateful hot reload that allow you to immediately see code changes in your app. Its portability enables you to deploy to a wide variety of platforms with the same source code and without surprises. And it’s fully open source, with no cost to license it or need to pay for tools to develop for it.
